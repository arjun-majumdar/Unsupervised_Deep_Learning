# Unsupervised_Deep_Learning
Self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning, etc.


### Implementations include:

1. Representation learning with [Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Image Rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07728) by Spyros Gidaris et al. on CIFAR-10 & STL-10 datasets. Comparisons using ResNet-18/50 CNNs.
1. [Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/He_Momentum_Contrast_for_Unsupervised_Visual_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) by Kaiming He et al. on STL-10 dataset.
2. [Improved Baselines with Momentum Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297) by Xinlei Chen et al. on STL-10 dataset
